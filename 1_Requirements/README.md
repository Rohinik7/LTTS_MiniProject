# Requirements

## INTRODUCTION
* The library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.

* This project is implemented in C language.

## RESEARCH
Most of the Library Management system consists of operations such as searching the books, displaying the information of books.This project involves signing in of the user and has account for each user where his/her books and various operation options can be displayed.

## Cost and Features
* The cost can be varied according to the modifications made and its usage in the market.
* Features:
  * It displays the list of members of library
  * Details about members can be accessed
  * Search books based on user input
  * Provides information of books including the issue date,author and publisher
  * User login: Students have to register themselves into the system to create an account.
  * Add and Update Books: The admin can add books to the system by entering the details of the books and can even update the details.
  * Search option: Admin and Students can even search for books by entering the name of the book.
  * View Order: The admin can view order for the books.
  * Place order: The students can place order for the books and simultaneously the quantity of the book ordered will be decremented.
  * Calculate Fine: The student can view the issue and expiry date for the book issued and can even calculate fine.

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

#### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
| SR.NO | REQUIREMENT |
|-------|-------------|
| 01    | Operating system(Windows/Linux)|
| 02    | Visual studio(IDE)|
| 03    | C Libraries|

#### HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
| SR.No | REQUIREMENT |
|-------|-------------|
| 01    | Processor-i3/i5/i7|
| 02    | Hard Disk (5 GB) |
| 03    | Memory (1 GB RAM) |

### LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

* User must be familiar with operating system.
* Functions to login to user account.
* Function to store user data.
* Function to search books based on user information.
* Function to display information of books.
* Function to manage purchases,renewal and fine.
* Function to return list of all members of library.
* Function to provide information of available books.

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

* Reliability: This software will be developed with machine learning, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques. So, in this step, there is no         certain reliable percentage that is measurable. Also, user- provided data will be used to compare with results and measure reliability. With recent machine   learning techniques, user gained data should be enough for reliability if enough data is obtained.
* Usability: It should be user-friendly and should require the least effort to operate.
* Portability: The system is made using Python, which is platform-independent and can be transported to other services with minimum effort.
* Flexibility: It is the effort required to modify an operational program. The whole system should be made using independent modules so that any changes done   in one module should not affect the other one and new modules can be added easily to increase the functionality.
* Maintainability: Maintenance is one form of change that typically is done after software development has been completed.
